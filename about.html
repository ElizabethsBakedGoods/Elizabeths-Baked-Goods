                <p>Hi, I'm Elizabeth, the hands, heart, and soul behind every treat you see here. Baking has been my passion for as long as I can remember — from the first time I carefully stirred sugar into butter in my childhood kitchen to the countless hours I've spent creating custom desserts for friends, family, and now the wonderful community here in Texas.</p>

                <p>I started Elizabeth's Baked Goods because I wanted to share more than just desserts — I wanted to share joy, comfort, creativity, and a little bit of magic in every bite. Every cookie, cake pop, brownie, and special treat you see here is made with love, attention to detail, and a dedication to quality ingredients, because I truly believe that desserts are more than food — they're experiences. They mark celebrations, comfort during hard days, small acts of kindness, and the moments we share with people we love.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">My Baking Journey 🕒</h2>

                <p>My journey into baking and culinary arts has been a winding path filled with lessons, discoveries, and moments of inspiration that shaped who I am as a baker today. It all began in my early years, when I found myself fascinated by the way simple ingredients could transform into something extraordinary. I remember vividly the first time I baked cookies from scratch. I measured the flour with precision, carefully folded in the chocolate chips, and watched as the dough slowly transformed in the oven into something golden and fragrant. That moment — the smell, the taste, and the joy of sharing it with my family — sparked a lifelong love of baking.</p>

                <p>When I decided to pursue formal training, I enrolled in culinary school. That experience was eye-opening in every way. I learned not only the technical skills of baking — measuring, mixing, whipping, folding, and baking with precision — but also the importance of discipline, patience, and creativity. Culinary school gave me the tools to experiment with flavors, textures, and techniques that I could never have learned on my own. I discovered the art behind pastries, the science behind perfect cookies, and the joy of crafting desserts that delighted both the eye and the palate.</p>

                <p>After school, life took me in a different direction for a while. I worked in preschools for several years. While it may not seem directly connected to baking, this experience was deeply formative. Working with children taught me patience, creativity, adaptability, and joy in the small things. I learned how to think on my feet, to be present in the moment, and to find delight in everyday interactions. These lessons are now deeply woven into my baking philosophy — from the playful design of cake pops to the small, thoughtful touches I add to every dessert I create.</p>

                <p>Eventually, my heart led me back to Texas, where I felt a deep pull to turn my passion for baking into a business that could share happiness with others. And so, Elizabeth's Baked Goods was born. Since then, I've poured my energy, creativity, and love into each treat, constantly learning and growing as a baker and business owner.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How Houston Shaped My Baking 🌆</h2>

                <p>Houston is a city of incredible diversity, creativity, and flavor, and living here has profoundly shaped the way I approach baking. From its vibrant food markets to its mix of cultures, Houston is a city that constantly inspires me to experiment, innovate, and explore. I've learned that the best desserts often come from blending traditions, flavors, and textures from different culinary worlds.</p>

                <p>In Houston, I discovered a fascination with fusion flavors. I love taking classic southern desserts — like buttery pound cakes, chocolate chip cookies, or pecan pies — and adding unexpected twists inspired by international cuisines. Maybe it's a tropical fruit that adds a bright, fresh note to a classic chocolate dessert, or a hint of warm spice that elevates a traditional cookie into something unforgettable. Houston taught me that desserts don't have to be one thing — they can be a story, a journey, and a celebration all at once.</p>

                <p>The city's incredible food markets have also been a playground for my creativity. I've spent countless mornings wandering through farmers' markets, local grocery stores, and specialty shops, searching for the freshest ingredients and the most unique flavors. Each new discovery — from a rare chocolate to a perfectly ripe fruit — is an opportunity to experiment and create something new and exciting. Houston's festivals and food events have been equally inspiring, showing me that people love desserts that surprise them, delight them, and make them feel special.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Baking Philosophy & Values 💖</h2>

                <p>At Elizabeth's Baked Goods, I believe that desserts are more than just sweets — they are expressions of joy, creativity, and care. Every item I make is crafted with intentionality:</p>

                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Freshness and quality</strong> are my top priorities. Every batch is handmade in small quantities, ensuring that every bite is perfect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creativity and innovation</strong> guide my flavor combinations and designs. I love experimenting with new techniques, colors, and tastes to create desserts that are both beautiful and memorable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection and joy</strong> are the heart of everything I do. Baking is about bringing people together, celebrating life's moments, and sharing happiness in a tangible, delicious way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I also believe in making desserts accessible and inclusive. Whether it's a birthday party, a family gathering, a corporate event, or just a small treat for yourself, my goal is to craft desserts that delight everyone and leave a lasting impression.</p>
