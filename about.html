            <div class="card-soft" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
                <p>Welcome to Elizabeth's Baked Goods — a home-grown, heart-driven bakery built from a simple love of creating treats that make people smile. What started as a few holiday cookie boxes for friends and family quickly grew into a full-time passion (and a kitchen that always smells like melted chocolate, butter, and vanilla).</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Where It All Started</h2>
                <p>I've always believed that food tells a story. Growing up, some of my favorite memories involved watching desserts come together — the sound of a mixer, the smell of caramelizing sugar, the excitement of waiting for cookies to cool. Over the years, I found myself recreating those moments for my own family, experimenting with recipes, and slowly building my own little baking world.</p>

                <p>One Christmas, I made dessert boxes as gifts… and suddenly, people were asking if they could <strong>buy</strong> them. What I thought was just a fun holiday tradition quickly became something bigger. I realized how much joy it brought me — not just baking, but creating desserts that meant something to someone else. A treat for a birthday. A "congratulations" gift. A comfort snack for a stressful week. A box that made someone's day.</p>

                <p>And that's how Elizabeth's Baked Goods was born.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">What Makes My Treats Different</h2>
                <p>I believe small-batch baking hits different. Every order is handmade from scratch, using premium ingredients — rich butter, real vanilla, high-quality chocolate, and fresh add-ins. Nothing mass-produced, nothing rushed. Every treat gets individual attention, from caramelizing sugar to piping macarons to decorating cookies one by one.</p>

                <p>I'm constantly perfecting recipes, testing new flavors, and finding ways to elevate classic favorites. Whether it's gourmet popcorn, macarons, seasonal boxes, or specialty holiday treats, everything is crafted with care, consistency, and a lot of love.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Baking as an Experience</h2>
                <p>For me, baking isn't just mixing ingredients. It's the process — the warmth of the oven, the art of timing, the creativity in design, and the satisfaction of packaging up something beautiful. I want every customer to feel like they're receiving something thoughtful and intentional.</p>

                <p>I also believe in transparency and storytelling. I love sharing the behind-the-scenes moments:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 2.2;">
                    <li>The batches I test and tweak</li>
                    <li>The holiday boxes I design</li>
                    <li>The new flavors I experiment with</li>
                    <li>The little victories (and occasional flops) that happen in the kitchen</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This business isn't just about desserts — it's about the craft, the learning, and the joy of creating something from scratch.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Made Locally, With Love</h2>

Whether you're grabbing something sweet for yourself or gifting a custom order to someone special, I'm honored to be a part of your celebrations, holidays, and everyday moments.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; color: #8b4513; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">What You Can Expect</h2>
                <p>When you order from me, you're supporting a small business that takes quality and customer experience seriously. My goals are simple:</p>

                </ul>
