        <p>
          Starting a home-based baking business in Texas has been one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my life. When I first decided to sell my baked goods, I assumed it would be as simple as perfecting recipes and taking orders. What I quickly learned is that building a compliant, profitable, and sustainable cottage food business requires understanding the law, creating solid systems, connecting with customers, and constantly improving. In this post, I want to share what I've learned about selling homemade baked goods in Texas so new and aspiring bakers can start with confidence.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Understanding the Texas Cottage Food Law</h2>

        <p>
          Texas is one of the most supportive states for home bakers thanks to its Cottage Food Law. This law allows individuals to sell certain homemade foods prepared in their home kitchens without needing a commercial kitchen or food establishment permit. However, there are very specific rules you must follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first thing I learned is that not all foods are allowed. Under the Cottage Food Law, you can sell items like cookies, breads, pastries, popcorn, dry mixes, candies, and similar shelf-stable foods. Anything that requires refrigeration, like cheesecakes or cream pies, is not allowed unless you operate out of a licensed commercial kitchen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Labeling is another important requirement. Each item you sell must include your name or business name, your home address, the name of the product, a full ingredients list, major allergens, and a statement that the product was made in a kitchen not inspected by the Department of State Health Services. It may sound intimidating at first, but once you create a simple template, labeling becomes easy.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can sell your products directly to customers in person or through online ordering for home pickup or direct delivery. What you cannot do is ship your baked goods across state lines or sell through third-party delivery services. Understanding these core rules set the foundation for running my business correctly.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Creating a Product Line That Makes Sense</h2>

        <p>
          When I first started baking for customers, I wanted to offer everything. That did not last long. I soon realized that keeping a small but strong menu is better for quality, cost control, and time management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began by focusing on the baked goods I was consistently great at making. For me, this included cookies, brownies, cereal bars, and holiday-themed treats. Once I perfected those items, I expanded into small seasonal offerings. Keeping my menu simple helped me buy ingredients in bulk, reduce waste, and stay organized during busy seasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another lesson I learned is that variety matters, but consistency matters more. Customers come back because they love knowing their favorite cookie will taste the exact same every time. Developing reliable recipes and sticking to them helped build trust with my customers.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Pricing My Baked Goods the Right Way</h2>

        <p>
          Pricing was one of the toughest lessons of all. When you're new, it's tempting to price low so people will buy from you. I learned quickly that undercharging will drain your energy, your finances, and your excitement. In Texas, home bakers can charge whatever they want, but your prices must reflect ingredients, time, packaging, utilities, and taxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started by calculating the exact cost of each recipe. Then, I added the value of my time. Finally, I looked at what other Texas bakers were charging for similar products. That helped me create fair prices that still made profit. Over time, I learned that high-quality ingredients, good packaging, and reliable service justify higher prices.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Building Trust Through Communication</h2>

        <p>
          The next thing I learned is that communication can make or break your business. Customers want updates, clear pickup instructions, expected delivery times, and transparency. Every message should be professional, friendly, and direct.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started sending order confirmations, reminders before pickup, and quick updates if anything changed. I also learned the importance of setting clear boundaries. If my pickup time is between 4:00 and 6:00, I stick to that schedule. Being consistent helps reduce stress and prevents misunderstandings.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Finding Ways to Market My Business</h2>

        <p>
          Texas has a strong community of home bakers, but the competition can be tough. I learned early on that good marketing matters just as much as good baking.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, word-of-mouth was powerful. My first customers were friends and neighbors. Then I began posting regularly on social media, sharing photos of my treats, behind-the-scenes videos, and holiday specials. I also participated in local markets and community events, which helped people discover my business in person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The biggest marketing lesson I learned is that people do not just buy baked goods; they buy the person behind them. Sharing my story, my process, and my passion helped me connect with customers who became loyal supporters.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Delivering Safely and Staying Compliant</h2>

        <p>
          Since Texas allows home bakers to deliver directly, I added local delivery to my services. I learned to plan delivery routes, keep items safe in warm temperatures, and confirm addresses ahead of time. I also created clear delivery fees based on distance, which helped me cover gas and time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Delivering items also means understanding the responsibility that comes with handling food. I made sure to keep a clean workspace, properly store ingredients, and follow food safety guidelines. Even though the state does not inspect cottage food kitchens, staying clean and organized helps protect both the business and the customers.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Growing Beyond the Cottage Kitchen</h2>

        <p>
          Over time, many Texas bakers expand beyond cottage food laws into commercial spaces, food trailers, or storefront bakeries. While I'm not there yet, I've learned to think about long-term growth. Understanding the difference between cottage food rules and commercial food establishment requirements helps me plan for the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I ever want to add refrigerated desserts, ship nationwide, or wholesale to stores, moving into a commercial kitchen would become necessary. For now, staying under the Cottage Food Law keeps things simple and affordable. But knowing my options helps me set long-term goals.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-weight: 700; color: #4d2c2a; font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Final Thoughts: What I Wish I Knew at the Beginning</h2>

        <p>
          Running a home baking business is not only about baking. It involves tracking orders, managing expenses, staying stocked on ingredients, and keeping accurate records for taxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the best decisions I made was creating a simple system for every part of the business. I created spreadsheets for expenses, a calendar for orders and deadlines, a printable menu, and a standard order form. These tools helped me stay professional and organized even during busy holiday seasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some home bakers use apps like Square, QuickBooks, or Notion. Others keep everything on paper. The important thing is choosing a system that works for you and sticking to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selling homemade baked goods in Texas is rewarding, but it's a real business. It takes time, consistency, and patience. Looking back, I wish I had known that success happens step by step, not overnight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most important lessons I've learned are simple: understand the law, price your products correctly, keep your menu manageable, communicate clearly, stay organized, and be genuine. Texas makes it possible for home bakers to thrive, and with the right mindset, anyone can build a successful and meaningful cottage food business.
