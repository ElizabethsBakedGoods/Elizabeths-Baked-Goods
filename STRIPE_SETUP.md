# Stripe Checkout Setup Instructions

Your site now has a shopping cart with dynamic shipping rates! Follow these steps to complete the setup:

## Step 1: Get Your Stripe Publishable Key

1. Log in to your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Make sure you're in **LIVE MODE** (toggle in the top right)
3. Click **Developers** â†’ **API keys**
4. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_...`)
5. Open `main.js` and replace `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE` with your actual key

## Step 2: Create Shipping Rates in Stripe

You need to create TWO shipping rates in your Stripe account:

### Flat Rate Shipping ($8)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/shipping-rates
2. Click **+ New** to create a new shipping rate
3. Fill in:
   - **Display name**: Standard Shipping
   - **Price**: $8.00 USD
   - **Delivery estimate**: 3-5 business days (or your timeframe)
   - **Type**: Fixed amount
4. Click **Create shipping rate**
5. **Copy the Shipping Rate ID** (starts with `shr_...`)
6. In `main.js`, replace `shr_FLAT_RATE_8_ID` with this ID

### Free Shipping ($0)
1. Click **+ New** again
2. Fill in:
   - **Display name**: Free Shipping
   - **Price**: $0.00 USD
   - **Delivery estimate**: 3-5 business days
   - **Type**: Fixed amount
3. Click **Create shipping rate**
4. **Copy the Shipping Rate ID** (starts with `shr_...`)
5. In `main.js`, replace `shr_FREE_SHIPPING_ID` with this ID

## Step 3: How It Works

- **$25 Minimum**: Customers must have at least $25 in their cart to checkout
- **Under $60**: Charged $8 flat rate shipping
- **$60 or more**: Automatically gets FREE shipping
- Cart dynamically calculates which rate to apply at checkout

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. Save all your changes and push to GitHub
2. Visit your live site
3. Try adding items to cart and clicking "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Verify:
   - Can't checkout with less than $25
   - Orders under $60 show $8 shipping
   - Orders $60+ show free shipping

## Important Notes

- Make sure you're using **LIVE MODE** keys and shipping rates (not test mode)
- The old payment links are replaced with the new cart system
- The Formspree form is still available for custom inquiries
- Customers can now order multiple items in one transaction
